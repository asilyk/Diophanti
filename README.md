Create any application to your liking, using only completed concepts. The main condition is to work in a team (at least 2 people). To work on the project, the team leader must create a common repository. The rest of the project participants must clone the repository onto their local machines. Each project participant must work in their own separate branch. When the work is done, all these branches must be merged into the main branch. In main there should always be only a release (working) version of the application.

### Binding terms
- Make a screen where all participants are represented
- Single code style of the entire project
- Each project participant must perform a code review of the other participants
- The team itself should be responsible for checking the code of its project
- That all teams in equal conditions are allowed to use only completed concepts

## About the app
Application for solving linear, square, cubic and logarithmic equations with the ability to obtain a complete solution. The user can also get acquainted with the theory of equation solving.
